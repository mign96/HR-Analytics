# HR Analytics Project

## Business scenario: AlphaLogistics (Hypothetical)

AlphaLogistics, a leading global supply chain and logistics conglomerate has experienced a noticeable turnover rate, and HR leadership is expecting deeper insights into the factors leading employees to leave the company. The HR team has been conducting surveys on employees to gather data, but now requires an analyst to turn the data into insights. By conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), we can systematically examine the historical HR data to uncover trends and patterns around employee attrition.

### Objective
* Gather, clean, and visualize employee data to identify any associations among demographics, tenure, performance, and other variables.
* Provide actionable insights on which employee segments are most at risk and why.
* Find root causes for why employees are leaving.
* Crete a presentation for HR executives for strategic insights on employee retention.

### Key Deliverables
* Cleaned dataset - Data cleaning to ensure no missing values, outliers, or duplicates before starting EDA.
* EDA and visualizations - Using charts and tables to explore variables, trends, correlations, and outliers.
* Initial recommendations - Brief presentation to C-suite executives.

### Key Stakeholders and Audience
* C-suite executives - convey key insights regarding the current state of the company
* HR executives - give strategic insights to assist strategic direction to shaping policies
* Operational managers - Managers and team leads who will use these findings to address day-to-day employee concerns, and think of immediate impacts.
